LFE, Lisp Flavoured Erlang, is a lisp syntax front-end to the Erlang
compiler. Code produced with it is compatible with "normal" Erlang
code. An LFE evaluator and shell is also included.

This is the first version with the modified internal core forms and
macro intefaces for the new CL inspired style and the older Scheme
inspired style.

Two new modules have been added:

lfe_boot allows you start Erlang with the LFE shell running and still
have ^G enabled and user_drv running. Use it as follows:

erl -noshell -noinput -s lfe_boot start

NOTE order of commands important, must be -noshell -noinput! Add -pa
to find modules if necessary.

lfe_gen is a trial interface for using LFE for dynamic code
generation. LFE is much easier to generate as an Erkang list than
Erlang forms. This module helps defining and compiling a module. Note,
that while it works, this module is very experimental and may change.
