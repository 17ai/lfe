LFE, Lisp Flavoured Erlang, is a lisp syntax front-end to the Erlang
compiler. Code produced with it is compatible with "normal" Erlang
code. An LFE evaluator and shell is also included.

This is the first version with the modified internal core forms and
macro intefaces for the new CL inspired style and the older Scheme
inspired style.
